# DeepSample

This repository provides the artifacts for DeepSample execution. 
The experiments on 9 DNN for classification and 2 DNN for regression can be replicated running the script 'run_DeepSample.sh'.
A time the experiments are completed, all the results are generated into the 'Results' folder.

The folder 'Results_paper' contains the results reported in the paper.

The folder 'dataset' contains the dataset with the models predictions and the auxiliary variables.
