# DeepSample

This repository provides the artifacts for DeepSample execution. 
The experiments on 9 DNN for classification and 2 DNN for regression can be replicated running the script 'run_DeepSample.sh'.
Once the experiments are completed, all the results are generated into the 'Results' folder.

The folder 'Results_paper' contains the results reported in the paper.

The folder 'dataset' contains the dataset with the models predictions and the auxiliary variables.

CES and SRS implementations are available at Li et al. repo 'https://github.com/Lizenan1995/DNNOpAcc'

The trained models are included in the 'models' folder.

The source code for the classification models is available at Guerriero et al. repo: 'https://github.com/ICOS-OAA/ICOS.git'
